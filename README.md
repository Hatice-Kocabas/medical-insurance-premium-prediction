# medical-insurance-premium-prediction
This project contains a machine learning model that predicts insurance costs based on age, gender, region, and smoking status of users. The project utilizes three different regression models: XGBoost, Random Forest, and Multiple Forest Regression to perform the insurance cost prediction. The performance of these models is compared to determine which one provides better results.
## Dataset
The dataset will be used to train and evaluate our insurance cost prediction model. The dataset should be in CSV format and named insurance.csv. It contains the following features:

###### age: Age of the insured individuals.
###### gender: Gender of the insured individuals (e.g., male or female).
###### region: Region where the insured individuals reside.
###### smoker: Smoking status of the insured individuals (1: smoker, 0: non-smoker).
###### child: the number of childs that individuals have
###### charges: Insurance costs.

## Result
Results
The project aims to predict insurance costs using different regression models. Based on the performance, the model that provides the best results will be specified in the model performance section. The obtained results could assist insurance companies and policyholders in better understanding and planning for future expenses.
